Key UI / Data Patterns (both panels)

Top nav + left sidebar for admin; compact mobile-friendly top nav for user.

Card-based tournament view so same UI can be used in app and web.

Tables with server-side pagination, sort, and advanced filters in admin.

Toasts & confirmations for destructive actions; require reason on wallet adjustments.

Role-based access control enforced on frontend UI and backend.

Real-time features: push notifications, websockets for live match updates and room-code release.

Uploads: screenshots for proof, team logos — limit size, virus scan, and image validation.

Auditability: every wallet change and admin action stores an audit entry.

Example Important Flows (step-by-step)

A. Player: Join + Play

User clicks Join on tournament page → opens Join modal

Select solo or team; confirm team roster

Review entry fee & prize split

Pay via wallet or gateway → transaction record created

Confirmation screen shows ticket ID + scheduled start

At match start, room code revealed only to joined players (or via secure channel)

Player plays, reports result (if required) → result verification queue

After verification, payout processed to winners

B. Admin: Create Tournament

Admin clicks Create Tournament → fill form (title, date/time, entry fee, prize, slots)

Choose auto room-code generation and anti-cheat options

Schedule publish / visibility (private/public)

Save → tournament appears in listing and can be edited

At start time admin can manually override room-code or trigger auto-release

Post-match: admin can review flagged results, approve & trigger payouts

Permissions & Security Notes

KYC enforced for withdrawals; show required KYC fields in profile.

Rate-limit sensitive endpoints (join, payment) and use transaction-idempotency.

Encryption for PII and payment tokens.

Impersonation for admin support: log and require reason.

Two-person approval for large manual wallet adjustments (> configurable threshold).

Payment reconciliation: daily automated job to reconcile gateway transactions with internal ledger.
